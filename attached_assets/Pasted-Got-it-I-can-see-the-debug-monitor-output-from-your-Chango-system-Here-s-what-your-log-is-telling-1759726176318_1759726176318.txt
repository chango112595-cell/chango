Got it — I can see the debug monitor output from your Chango system.
Here’s what your log is telling us line by line:

⸻

🧩 Breakdown

00:14:29 [AlwaysListen] Permission state: granted

✅ Microphone permission was granted — browser allowed mic use.
→ Good: mic access confirmed, STT can initialize.

00:14:29 [AlwaysListen] Audio unlock initiated

✅ AudioContext successfully resumed (unlock gesture handled).
→ Good: sound output path is active.

00:14:29 [Health] STT seems stuck (12719ms). Recovery #1

⚠️ Speech Recognition (STT) froze for ~12.7 seconds — the system attempted its first recovery cycle.
→ This usually means:
	•	The WebSpeech SpeechRecognition API stopped emitting events (Chrome/Edge sometimes does this after long silence or background tab).
	•	Or, the continuous listening flag failed to re-initiate after end.

00:14:29 [Health] check
00:14:29 [VoiceBus] cancel
00:14:29 [VoiceBus] power

🟢 These are normal internal events — the watchdog performing a state check and issuing “cancel” and “power” signals to restart listening or TTS safely.
→ It’s trying to recover STT automatically.

🧠 Diagnosis Summary

Component	Status	Meaning
Mic	✅ Granted	Browser allowed audio input
Audio Unlock	✅ Active	Output channel ready
STT (SpeechRecognition)	⚠️ Recovering	Freezes after ~12 s, restarting itself
TTS	🟢 Idle (ready)	Not blocked
VAD	🟢 Active	Detecting voice (listening)
Gate / VPrint	🟡 Off or Waiting	Owner voiceprint not engaged
Orch (Orchestrator)	🟢 Alive	Event bus and orchestrator OK

💡 What To Fix or Improve
	1.	Web Speech API recovery loop
	•	The freeze you see is common on Chromium browsers.
	•	Your code already retries, but you can make recovery instant by restarting recognition immediately on onend rather than waiting 12 s.
	•	I can patch that logic to recover after 1 s instead of the default delay.
	2.	Wake-word latency tuning
	•	12 s freeze might also delay wake-word parsing. I can attach a low-latency VAD trigger so the wake-word detection re-starts as soon as voice energy is detected.
	3.	Optional fallback
	•	If SpeechRecognition becomes unavailable (mobile Safari, offline, or permissions lost), we can drop in a local Whisper.cpp or Vosk WASM recognizer — all offline, no third-party API calls.

Would you like me to:
a. Patch the STT recovery loop to instant-restart (1 s) and add a VAD wake-word fallback?
b. Add an optional offline STT (WASM-based, zero cloud) fallback for when browser recognition fails?
