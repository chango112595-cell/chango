Perfectâ€”locking a checkpoint first, then making MCP bring-up = Priority 0.

1) One-click checkpoint + task update (paste in Admin Patch)

Paste this JSON in the Patch Console and send:

{
  "note": "Checkpoint + promote MCP to Priority 0",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "docs/checkpoints/2025-09-27_checkpoint_v-current.md",
      "content": "# ChangoAI Checkpoint â€” 2025-09-27\n\n**Scope**: Consolidated current working build (voice routes, hologram HUD, logs/approvals, curiosity baseline wiring).\n**Why**: Safe point before MCP integration.\n**What works**: Server @ :5000, HUD, Admin Patch Console (/dev/write), logging, voice pipeline baseline.\n**Risks**: Replit ZIP import variability; MCP not yet enabled.\n**Next**: Priority 0 â€” MCP connector bring-up.\n"
    },
    {
      "path": "docs/tasks/MASTER_TASKS_2025-09-27.md",
      "content": "# Master Task Priorities â€” 2025-09-27\n\n## Priority 0 â€” MCP Connector Bring-Up (NEW)\n- Stand up wss:// endpoint `/mcp` with token auth (MCP_TOKEN secret)\n- Health-check from desktop ChatGPT custom connector\n- Tools exposed: list_files, write_file (isolated), read_file (ro)\n- Success = ChatGPT can list repo + write a test file via MCP\n\n## Priority 1 â€” Lab Log & Checkpoints (READY)\n- Status: âœ… Active.

    },
    {
      "path": "logs/DEV_NOTES/2025-09-27_mcp_objective.txt",
      "content": "Create secure MCP websocket endpoint at /mcp (wss) with token gate. Expose tools: list_files, write_file, read_file(ro). Verify connector from desktop ChatGPT. Roll forward only after success log recorded."
    }
  ]
}

Result:
	â€¢	New checkpoint saved under docs/checkpoints/â€¦
	â€¢	A dated Master Tasks file with MCP as Priority 0
	â€¢	A dev note for quick reference

2) What we do next (Priority 0)

After applying the patch, Iâ€™ll hand you the exact code to:
	â€¢	add /mcp WSS server,
	â€¢	set MCP_TOKEN in Replit Secrets,
	â€¢	test the connector from desktop ChatGPT.

When MCP passes health-check, we proceed with live, continuous development.
