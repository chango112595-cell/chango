# Testing the Date Intent Fix

## How to Test in Browser Console

Open the browser console (F12) and run these commands:

### Test 1: Direct Route Testing
```javascript
// Test if the conversation engine is available
if (window.conversationEngine) {
  // Test "what is today"
  console.log('Testing "what is today"...');
  const response1 = window.conversationEngine.route('what is today');
  console.log('Response:', response1);
  
  // Test "what's today"
  console.log('Testing "what\'s today"...');
  const response2 = window.conversationEngine.route("what's today");
  console.log('Response:', response2);
  
  // Test "today's date"
  console.log('Testing "today\'s date"...');
  const response3 = window.conversationEngine.route("today's date");
  console.log('Response:', response3);
}
```

### Test 2: Through Voice Bus
```javascript
// Test through the voice bus system
if (window.voiceBus) {
  // Emit a user text submission
  window.voiceBus.emit({
    type: 'userTextSubmitted',
    text: 'what is today'
  });
  
  // Check console for ConversationEngine logs
  // Should see:
  // [ConversationEngine] 🔍 Routing text: what is today
  // [ConversationEngine] 📅 Matched DATE intent
}
```

### Test 3: Using Ask Bar
1. Type "what is today" in the Ask bar at the bottom of the screen
2. Press Enter
3. Check if Lolo responds with today's date

## Expected Results
- Should see logging like:
  - `[ConversationEngine] 🔍 Routing text: what is today`
  - `[ConversationEngine] 📅 Matched DATE intent`
- Should get response: "Today is Thursday, October 2, 2025" (or current date)
- Should NOT see: "I'm not sure how to respond to that"

## Verify Fix
✅ "what is today" matches date intent
✅ "what's today" matches date intent  
✅ "today's date" matches date intent
✅ Proper logging shows intent matching
✅ Response includes day of week, month, and day
